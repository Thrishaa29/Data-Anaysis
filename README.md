# Zomata Sales Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a food delivery service dataset (presumably from a Zomato-like platform) to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and performance metrics. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## 📊 Objective

- To understand order patterns across months, weekdays, and hours.
- To identify top-selling food items and customer preferences.
- To uncover trends that can inform business decisions.

## 📁 Files

- `ZomataSales.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📈 Key Insights

- Analyzed orders by time (months, weekdays, and hours).
- Identified most frequently ordered food items.
- Uncovered sales trends and peak order times.
- Visualized the contribution of various menu items to total sales.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Install required Python libraries:
    ```bash
